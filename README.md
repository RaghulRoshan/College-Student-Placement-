# College-Student-Placement-


 I was looking at a dataset today. It's about college placements. It has data for 10,000 students  data and 10 columns of data . The first column is the college ID, which is about the students' IDs. Then there's IQ, which lists each student's IQ. After that, there's semester result, which shows how many marks they scored in each semester. They've also calculated the CGPA. They've also calculated academic performance, checked if they've done internships, looked at extracurricular activities, assessed communication skills is good or bad and ect , and categorized whether they've done projects and how many. And finally, there's a placement column. It shows whether a student got placed based on their performance. The placement is assigned based on factors like IQ, exam results, CGPA, academic performance, internships, extracurricular activities, communication skills, and projects. It's a yes or no situation – "yes" means they got placed, and "no" means they didn't. placed in any company. I understood that  the placement cloumn data and this  dataset is used for supervised learning, and more specifically, it falls under the category of classification.(Yes/No)
